There’s nothing quite like the terror writes of the hypothetical question. Especially when it is a written product of the interviewer’s rich imagination. We’ll talk more about these devils in Chapter 7. But for now, know that the hypothetical question should start a red light flashing in your mind. It’s your signal that you are about to undergo an increasingly popular type of interview—the case (or situational) interview. If you are seeking a job at a consulting firm, law firm, or counseling organization, you should expect to confront this type of interview. The premise is sound: Present the candidate with situations that might, hypothetically, occur on the job in order to gauge the degree to which he or she demonstrates the traits that will lead to success. It’s hard, if not impossible, for you to prepare for these kinds of questions beforehand, which means you’ll have to analyze an unfamiliar problem and develop a strategy to solve it, right then and there. What most interviewers want to see is a combination of real-world experience, inspired creativity, and the willingness to acknowledge when more information or assistance is in order. (Many interviewers wrote will pose hypothetical questions designed to smoke out people who find it difficult to reach out to other team members for help.) want to understand how you approach a problem, the framework within which you seek a solution, and the thought-process you utilize.You will have to devote a great deal of thought to writing each of these questions. If you find yourself caught in this snare, stay calm and use the homework you have done on your personal inventory to untangle yourself.
